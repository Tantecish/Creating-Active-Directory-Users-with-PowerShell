# Generate passwords by "Manytools Password Generator"
# Create an OU in AD with the name of IT
# Right click on the OU with the name of IT - click properties - attribute editor - Find the attribute distinguishedName - Double-click on it and copy the value
# value in my example is OU=IT,OU=Users,OU=Company,DC=exoip,DC=local
# Place the value in the fields under the column OU
# Save it as type CSV UTF-8 (Comma delimited) (*.csv). Click the button Save.
# NewUsersFinal.csv is created.
# Run PowerShell as administrator. Use the Import-Csv cmdlet to read the CSV file.
# If it can’t read the CSV file, remove the -Delimiter parameter. It will be Import-Csv “C:\Temp\NewUsersFinal.csv” | Format-Table.

# You learned how to create Active Directory Users from CSV with PowerShell
# First, prepare the CSV file and make sure all the information is filled in
# When you have the final CSV file, import the CSV file in PowerShell to check if it’s readable
# Adjust the two lines in the Add-NewUsers.ps1 script, as shown in the article. Run the script to create the users in AD
# The last part is to check if the users are created successfully in ADUC.
